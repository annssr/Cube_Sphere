# Cube_Sphere
## Overview
 Converts a 6-sided cube panorama's projection into a spherical panorama projection, with configurable ratios

## Executable
dist -> Cube_Sphere -> Cube_Sphere.exe

## How-to
Open the executable, browse and select an image from your computer, and click the "Generate" button.
Wait until the bottom-left text says "Done".
dist -> Sphere_Images
You will find the generated spherical panorama as generated_image.png.
The process perserves resolution, so expect large images to take longer, approximately 40 seconds for a 3200x2400.
